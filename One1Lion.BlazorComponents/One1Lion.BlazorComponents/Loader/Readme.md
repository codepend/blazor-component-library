This is a library of loaders.  The Ivan Loaders are from a [CodePen pen](https://codepen.io/vank0/pen/mARwLg) by the user [vank0](https://codepen.io/vank0).  They note: 

All loaders here need to meet following requirements:
- their size must depend on the font-size of their parent;
- they must only use the color of their parent;
- they must be single elements with no children elments;

The three box loader is an adaptation of the CSS Box Loader found [here](https://paulund.co.uk/css-box-loader).
